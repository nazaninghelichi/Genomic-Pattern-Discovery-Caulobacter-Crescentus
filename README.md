# Genomic-Pattern-Discovery-Caulobacter-Crescentus
Analyzing genomic sequences using unsupervised learning to identify potential gene patterns in bacterial DNA.
📌 Project Summary

This project explores a 300kb DNA sequence from the Caulobacter Crescentus genome to uncover hidden patterns using statistical and unsupervised learning techniques. The objective is to separate biologically meaningful gene sequences from noise, without any labeled data. The approach involves sequence encoding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering to find internal structure within the genetic information.

🏭 Industry Context

Industry: Bioinformatics / Genomics
Understanding and extracting patterns from DNA is critical in biotechnology and medical research. Tools like PCA and clustering help researchers discover genes, mutations, or regulatory motifs when no prior annotation exists.
💻 Tech Stack

Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
🔍 Key Features

✅ Preprocessing of raw genomic sequences into structured numerical format
✅ Frequency analysis of k-mers (1–4 base pair subsequences)
✅ Dimensionality reduction with PCA to reveal patterns
✅ Clustering using unsupervised methods (e.g., KMeans) to group similar sequence regions
📊 Results

📈 PCA helped reduce dimensionality while preserving variance and exposing latent structure
🧠 Clusters indicated potential differentiation between meaningful gene-like regions and random noise
